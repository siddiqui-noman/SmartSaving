## 🏗️ How it works

```
UI (Screens)
    ↓
State Management (Riverpod)
    ↓
Business Logic (Providers)
    ↓
Services (Amazon, Flipkart, Auth)
    ↓
Local Storage (Shared Preferences)
```

We used **Riverpod** for state management because it's clean and easy to test. **Shared Preferences** stores everything locally so the app works even without internet (with cached data).

## 🛠️ What we used

| What                   | Why                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Flutter**            | Cross-platform (Android + iOS in one codebase) |
| **Riverpod**           | State management is easier                     |
| **Material Design 3**  | Looks modern and professional                  |
| **FL Chart**           | Price history charts look beautiful            |
| **Shared Preferences** | Store data locally, simple & reliable          |
